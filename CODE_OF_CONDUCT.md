- Intimidation or unwelcome attention.
- Any form of offensive comments or behavior.

## Responsibilities of Contributors

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Contributors are expected to adhere to these standards in all project spaces, including code, documentation, issues, pull requests, and any other communication channels.

## Reporting Violations

If you witness or experience behavior that violates the Code of Conduct, please report it to [ilyas.assakali@student.ehb.be]. All reports will be kept confidential, and the project maintainers will respond as soon as possible.

## Consequences for Unacceptable Behavior

Unacceptable behavior will not be tolerated. Project maintainers may take corrective action, including warning, temporary ban, or permanent expulsion from the project, as deemed appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all project spaces and interactions, both online and offline. It also extends to behaviors that may impact the project community even when outside the project spaces.
